### Advanced Search

There are many other ways to search for the documents that are available to advanced users:
- cabinets
- favorites
- tags
- workflows 
- checkouts
- whoosh search engine

So let's take a look at how these things work:

#### Searching by Cabinets

The user can file the document in the specific folder under `cabinets/details`

Certain users may create their own cabinet, and upload their own documents for individual use.

#### Searching by Favorites
Each user has their own favorites folder located under `Documents` panel. A user may want to `favorite` a file in one of two ways:
